# Given a string, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence.
# A subsequence is a string generated from the original string by deleting 0 or more 
# characters and without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
# Ex.: input "AABEBCDD" => longest repeating subsequence ABD - length 3
# Python implementation
